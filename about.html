                The need for having motto for the Corps was discussed in the 11th Central Advisory Committee (CAC)
                meeting held on 11 Aug 1978. The mottos suggested were <b> “Duty and Discipline”; </b>“Duty, Unity and
                Discipline”; “Duty and Unity”; “Unity and Discipline”. The final decision for selection of “Unity and
                Discipline” as motto for the NCC was taken in the 12th CAC meeting held on 12 Oct 1980.
